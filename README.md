## Focus Areas

- As Founder of Deep Vertical AI, I identified the critical gap between cutting-edge AI capability and institutional ownership requirements, establishing a boutique consultancy model based on bespoke system development and complete IP transfer.

- As Lead Architect, I design custom financial intelligence systems for each client, ensuring complete data sovereignty and operational independence upon delivery.

- Conceived and engineered VERA (VERA â€” Vertical Evidence & Reasoning Architecture) - our flagship reference architecture that serves as the blueprint for every bespoke system we build. VERA demonstrates the power of multi-model orchestration while ensuring each client receives their own customized version deployed within their security perimeter.

- Pioneered "Triple Grounding" Architecture: Designed verification systems that ground AI-generated insights against client's internal data, external market intelligence, and computational verification, ensuring auditable and trustworthy outputs for regulatory compliance.

- Architected Vendor-Agnostic Multi-Model Systems: Built orchestration engines that intelligently coordinate Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, GPT-5, and local models, ensuring clients never face vendor lock-in while always accessing best-in-class AI capabilities.

- Engineered for Complete Data Sovereignty: Implemented hybrid cloud/on-premises architectures with sensitive data detection and intelligent routing, guaranteeing client data never leaves their security perimeter - a non-negotiable for financial institutions.

- Innovated Transparent AI Systems: Developed real-time reasoning visualization systems that expose AI decision-making processes, building institutional trust through complete transparency and auditability.

- Established Bespoke IP Transfer Model: Created the engineering processes and documentation standards that enable complete knowledge transfer, ensuring clients achieve full operational independence of their custom AI systems.
